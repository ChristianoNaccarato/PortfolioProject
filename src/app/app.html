  <h2>My Best Work</h2>
  <h3>2020 Best Work</h3>
  <p>
    In grade 10 back in 2020, I created pong using python as my final project for my
    computer programming class. It was my first real experience with coding, and it sparked
    the passion for computer science that I've been pursuing ever since.

  <h3>2024 Best Work</h3>
  <p>
    During my second semester of the Mobile Application Development program, I completed my first group project in
    java. Two classmate and I worked together to build a fully functional Checkers game using JavaFx.
    We fully created the game with all the proper game logic and it remains one of my favorite projects to this day.

  <h3>2025 Best Work</h3>
  <p>During my third semester of the MAD program, I completed another group project with two classmates.
    What makes this project so stand out is that its not just a simple game but a fully functioning library inventory
    managing system. While it may sound boring it serves a great purpose in the real life world giving us great
    experience working with databases and user interfaces.
